LoRA Training Dataset & Usage Guide

This repository provides the training file used to fine-tune six 7B instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).
It also demonstrates how to load and use the trained LoRA adapters from Hugging Face in Python.

📌 Models Trained with This Dataset

The same training file was used to fine-tune the following base models:

google/gemma-7b-it

tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct

meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf

Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct

mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2

ibm-granite/granite-7b-instruct

Each model was trained independently using LoRA to reduce compute and memory requirements while preserving instruction-following performance.

📂 Training File Description

Format: Instruction-based text (instruction / input / output)

Purpose: Fine-tuning instruction-following behavior

Method: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA

Compatibility: Works with Hugging Face transformers + peft

This dataset can be reused to train additional LoRA adapters on other compatible 7B models.

🤗 Available LoRA Adapters on Hugging Face

The trained LoRA adapters are publicly available:

KraveTech/Falcon7B_LoRA

KraveTech/Mistral7B_LoRA

KraveTech/Gemma7B_LoRA

KraveTech/Llama7B_LoRA

KraveTech/Qwen7B_LoRA

KraveTech/Granite7B_LoRA

🚀 How to Use a LoRA Adapter in Python

Below is a standard example for loading a base model and applying a LoRA adapter using Hugging Face.

🔧 Install Dependencies
pip install torch transformers peft accelerate

🧠 Example: Load Base Model + LoRA Adapter
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
from peft import PeftModel

# Choose base model and LoRA adapter
base_model_name = "tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct"
lora_adapter_name = "KraveTech/Falcon7B_LoRA"

# Load tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model_name)

# Load base model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    base_model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map="auto"
)

# Load LoRA adapter
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, lora_adapter_name)
model.eval()

# Run inference
prompt = "Explain what LoRA fine-tuning is in simple terms."

inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model.generate(
        **inputs,
        max_new_tokens=200,
        do_sample=True,
        temperature=0.7
    )

print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))

🔁 Switching to Another LoRA Adapter

To use a different LoRA model, simply change:

base_model_name = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2"
lora_adapter_name = "KraveTech/Mistral7B_LoRA"


⚠️ Important:
The LoRA adapter must match the base model architecture it was trained on.

📊 Benefits of LoRA Training

✅ Reduced GPU memory usage

✅ Faster fine-tuning

✅ No modification to original model weights

✅ Easy adapter swapping

📜 License & Usage

Base models are subject to their original licenses.

LoRA adapters are released for research and development purposes.

Please review Hugging Face model licenses before commercial use.
